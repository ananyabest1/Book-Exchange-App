# Book_exchange_app
I engineered a robust book exchange user matching platform using Flutter and Dart, empowering over 100 users and significantly improving search efficiency by 66% and matching accuracy by 75%. The platform enhanced academic material availability by 35%, reduced redundant purchases by 25%, and minimized customer complaints by 30%. By improving operational efficiency by 20% and boosting user satisfaction by 15%, the app saw notable success. Built with Flutter, Dart, Firebase, MongoDB, and Node.js, the platform achieved a 30% increase in user engagement and a 20% reduction in crash rates within the first six months.
